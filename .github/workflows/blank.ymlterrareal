 This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions:
      - name: Run a one-line script https://github.com/Jorgemucisalumfilho/remix-projectterrareal/blob/master/Dockerfile autocreate 
name: criptomoeda terrareal 
  autocreate:       - name: Run a one-line script
 Controls when the workflow will run
on:       - name: Run a one-line script 
   Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push: autocreate 
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request: autocreate 
    branches: [ "main" ]
rum: script autocreate 
   Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch: autocreate 
rum: autom√°tico 
 A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
   This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
     The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

     Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
       Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

       Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: terrareal Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      - name: Run a multi-line script
